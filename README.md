[This repository contains a collection of enhancement methods useful for retinal fundus images, with emphasis on Pixel Color Amplification.](https://github.com/adgaudio/ietk-ret)
These methods are very useful as a pre-processing step to fundus image analysis and machine learning. They have applicability to a wide variety of image domains, but we focus on retinal fundus images.

[How to Visualize Deep Learning Models](https://neptune.ai/blog/deep-learning-visualization)

Deep learning models are typically highly complex. While many traditional machine learning models make do with just a couple of hundreds of parameters, deep learning models have millions or billions of parameters. The large language model GPT-4 that OpenAI released in the spring of 2023 is rumored to have nearly 2 trillion parameters. It goes without saying that the interplay between all these parameters is way too complicated for humans to understand.

This is where visualizations in ML come in. Graphical representations of structures and data flow within a deep learning model make its complexity easier to comprehend and enable insight into its decision-making process. With the proper visualization method and a systematic approach, many seemingly mysterious training issues and underperformance of deep learning models can be traced back to root causes.

In this article, we’ll explore a wide range of deep learning visualizations and discuss their applicability. Along the way, I’ll share many practical examples and point to libraries and in-depth tutorials for individual methods.
